# I don't know what to currently do

My inspiration was a YouTube channel called **Pixeled**, which I only watched the "Creating a compiler from scratch" videos of.
But now, I currently don't have any guides or anyone to help me. I was thinking about giving up, but this project keeps me sane (even though itâ€™s also the thing that drives me insane).
I don't think anyone will see this, but if you do, I would be interested in any kind of help. I don't usually check my emails, but please contact me there if you want: [alihamzatasova@gmail.com](alihamzatasova@gmail.com).
